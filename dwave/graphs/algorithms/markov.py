    """Samples from a Markov network using the provided sampler.

    Args:
        MN:
            A Markov network as returned by
            :func:`~dwave.graphs.generators.markov.markov_network`. Potentials
            data is stored in a node/edge attribute ``potential``.

        sampler:
            A dimod sampler.

        fixed_variables:
            A dictionary of variable assignments to be fixed in the Markov
            network.

        return_sampleset:
            If True, returns a :class:`~dimod.SampleSet` rather than a list of
            samples.

        **sampler_args:
            Additional keyword parameters are passed to the sampler.

    Returns:
        A list of samples ordered from low-to-high energy or a sample set.

    Examples:

    >>> import dimod
    ...
    >>> potentials = {('a', 'b'): {(0, 0): -1,
    ...                            (0, 1): .5,

    >>> MN = dwave.graphs.markov_network(potentials)
    >>> sampler = dimod.ExactSolver()
    >>> samples = dwave.graphs.sample_markov_network(MN, sampler)

    >>> samples[0]           # doctest: +SKIP
    {'a': 0, 'c': 0, 'b': 0}

    Note:
        Samplers by their nature may not return the optimal solution. This
        function does not attempt to confirm the quality of the returned sample.
