    """Returns an approximate set of frustrated edges and a bicoloring.

    A signed social network graph is a graph whose signed edges represent
    friendly/hostile interactions between nodes. A signed social network is
    considered balanced if it can be cleanly divided into two factions, where
    all relations within a faction are friendly, and all relations between
    factions are hostile. The measure of imbalance or frustration is the minimum
    number of edges that violate this rule.

    Args:
        graph:
            A social graph (in a NetworkX graph) on which each edge has a 'sign'
            attribute with a numeric value.

        sampler:
            A dimod sampler.

        **sampler_args:
            Additional keyword parameters passed to the sampler.

    Returns:
        A tuple with two dictionaries:

        - frustrated_edges:
            A dictionary of the edges that violate the edge sign. The imbalance
            of the network is the length of frustrated_edges.

        - colors:
            A bicoloring of the nodes into two factions.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any edge does not have a 'sign' attribute.

    Examples:
        >>> import dimod
        >>> sampler = dimod.ExactSolver()
        >>> S = nx.Graph()
        >>> S.add_edge('Alice', 'Bob', sign=1)   # Alice and Bob are friendly
        >>> S.add_edge('Alice', 'Eve', sign=-1)  # Alice and Eve are hostile
        >>> S.add_edge('Bob', 'Eve', sign=-1)    # Bob and Eve are hostile
        >>> frustrated_edges, colors = dwave.graphs.structural_imbalance(S, sampler)
        >>> print(frustrated_edges)
        {}
        >>> print(colors)  # doctest: +SKIP
        {'Alice': 0, 'Bob': 0, 'Eve': 1}
        >>> S.add_edge('Ted', 'Bob', sign=1)     # Ted is friendly with all
        >>> S.add_edge('Ted', 'Alice', sign=1)
        >>> S.add_edge('Ted', 'Eve', sign=1)
        >>> frustrated_edges, colors = dwave.graphs.structural_imbalance(S, sampler)
        >>> print(frustrated_edges)  # doctest: +SKIP
        {('Ted', 'Eve'): {'sign': 1}}
        >>> print(colors)  # doctest: +SKIP
        {'Bob': 1, 'Ted': 1, 'Alice': 1, 'Eve': 0}

    Note:
        Samplers by their nature may not return the optimal solution. This
        function does not attempt to confirm the quality of the returned sample.
