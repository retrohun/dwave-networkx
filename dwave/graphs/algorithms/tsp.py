    """Returns an approximate minimum traveling salesperson route.

    Defines a binary quadratic model (:term:`BQM`) with ground states corresponding to
    the minimum routes and uses the sampler to sample from it.

    A route is a cycle in the graph that reaches each node exactly once.
    A minimum route is a route with the smallest total edge weight.

    Args:
        graph:
            The graph on which to find a minimum traveling salesperson route.
            This should be a complete graph with non-zero weights on every edge.

        sampler:
            A dimod sampler.

        lagrange:
            Lagrange parameter to weight constraints (visit every city once)
            versus objective (shortest distance route). If not specified, it's
            estimated based on graph size.
            See :meth:`~dimod.generators.tsp.traveling_salesperson` BQM generator.

        weight:
            The name of the edge attribute containing the weight.

        start:
            If provided, the route will begin at ``start``.

        **sampler_args:
            Additional keyword parameters passed to the sampler.

    Returns:
       List of nodes in order to be visited on a route.

    Example:
        >>> import dimod
        >>> import dwave.graphs
        >>> import networkx
        ...
        >>> G = networkx.Graph()
        >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from({(0, 1, .1), (0, 2, .5), (0, 3, .1),
        ...                            (1, 2, .1), (1, 3, .5), (2, 3, .1)})
        >>> dwave.graphs.traveling_salesperson(G, dimod.ExactSolver(), start=0) # doctest: +SKIP
        [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Note:
        Samplers by their nature may not return the optimal solution. This
        function does not attempt to confirm the quality of the returned sample.
