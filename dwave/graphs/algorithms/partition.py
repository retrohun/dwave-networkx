    """Return an approximate k-partition of ``graph``.

    Defines a :term:`CQM` with ground states corresponding to a balanced k-partition of
    ``graph`` and uses the sampler to sample from it.
    A k-partition is a collection of :math:`k` subsets of the vertices of ``graph`` such
    that each vertex is in exactly one subset, and the number of edges between
    vertices in different subsets is as small as possible. If ``graph`` is a
    weighted graph, the sum of weights over those edges are minimized.

    Args:
        graph:
            The graph to partition. Either an integer ``n``, interpreted as a
            complete graph of size ``n``, a nodes/edges pair, a list of edges or
            a NetworkX graph. When NetworkX graph is provided, optional edge
            weights can be provided in the ``weight`` attribute.

        sampler:
            A dimod sampler.

        num_partitions:
            The number of subsets in the desired partition.

        **sampler_args:
            Additional keyword parameters are passed to the sampler.

    Returns:
        The partition as a dictionary mapping each node to subsets labelled
        as integers 0, 1, 2, ... ``num_partitions``.

    Example:
        This example uses a dimod reference sampler
        :class:`~dimod.reference.samplers.ExactCQMSolver` to find a 2-partition
        for a graph of a Chimera unit cell created using the
        :meth:`~dwave.graphs.generators.chimera.chimera_graph` function.

        >>> import dimod
        >>> import dwave.graphs
        ...
        >>> sampler = dimod.ExactCQMSolver()
        >>> G = dwave.graphs.chimera_graph(1, 1, 4)
        >>> partitions = dwave.graphs.partition(G, sampler=sampler)
